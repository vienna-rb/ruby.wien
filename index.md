## Join The Community

Welcome to the Vienna Ruby User Group. We meet every quarter to learn together, listen to awesome talks, and discuss everything Ruby. Join us as we explore the latest trends in the Ruby and Ruby on Rails ecosystem, listen to entrepreneurs building their business on Ruby, or discover hidden gems and quirks of the Ruby programming language.
